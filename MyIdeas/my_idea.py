##Here's a simple example of a list comprehension that generates a list of squared numbers from another list:

##python
##Copy code
#numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]
#In this example, squared_numbers will contain [1, 4, 9, 16, 25].

#List comprehensions can make your code more concise and readable when creating new lists by transforming or filtering elements from an existing iterable.
